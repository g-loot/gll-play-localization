Pages.brawl.brawlRulesP1=G-Loot wants esports to be safe and fun for everyone, so we take\n            player protection very seriously and investigate any suspicious\n            activity. Make sure you read the rules before your first Brawl, so you\n            know what you can and can't do while playing on G-Loot! Here are some\n            of our most important rules:
Pages.brawl.brawlRulesP2=<c>{text}</c> Playing from multiple game accounts while\n            participating in G-Loot competitions is considered in-game smurfing.
Pages.brawl.brawlRulesP3=<c>{text}</c> or your G-Loot account with anyone (for\n                example: you cannot use the same Valorant account on two G-Loot\n                accounts). Do not sell or buy game- or G-Loot accounts.
Pages.brawl.brawlRulesP4=<c>{text}</c> Do not create additional G-Loot\n            accounts for any reason.
Pages.brawl.brawlRulesP5=<c>{text}</c> We take reports of cheating very seriously and investigate them thoroughly.
Pages.brawl.brawlRulesP6=For the full list of rules read our <c>{text}</c>  and G-Loot’s <d>{text2}</d>\n

howItWorks.faq.question0=Is G-Loot available on Mac/mobile/console?
howItWorks.faqSection.answer0=Right now, G-Loot is only available on PC. We’re researching how we can bring G-Loot to more devices in the future, but there’s no timeline for this yet. <a>Check out the system requirements for G-Loot.</a>
howItWorks.faqSection.answer1=Absolutely! There are plenty of different ways to compete to suit your style and ability.
howItWorks.faqSection.answer2=It’s completely up to you. You can enter Missions, Brawls, and Tournaments using only virtual currencies that you earn on G-Loot. If you want to, you can purchase extra Tokens. You can also become a G-Loot Premium subscriber and get access to extra Missions and other perks.
howItWorks.faqSection.answer3=Yes. You can learn more about our policies on the <a>support pages</a>, but the most important points are: {lineBreak}- G-Loot is not gambling because it’s not based on luck. Like other sports that offer prize money, it is based entirely on your own skill. {lineBreak}- G-Loot is only available in regions where skill-based gaming is legal. {lineBreak}- We only track the data required to bring you the best possible experience when using G-Loot. {lineBreak}- We take your safety very seriously and have teamed up with partners like PayPal, Sum&Substance, and Anybrain to make sure everything you do on G-Loot is fair and secure.
howItWorks.faqSection.answer4=We’re always happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have. Please <a>get in touch with us</a>.
howItWorks.faqSection.question1=I’m not a high-level player. Can I still use G-Loot?
howItWorks.faqSection.question2=Does G-Loot cost money to use?
howItWorks.faqSection.question3=Is G-Loot legal and safe?

howItWorks.topSection.header=Overview
howItWorks.topSection.title=How it works
howItWorksSection.brawlBody=Brawls are weekly competitions where you compete against other G-Loot players in a leaderboard to earn bigger rewards.{lineBreak}Like Missions, Brawls are based on your game stats (such as kills or damage.) You don’t play directly against other competitors; you just need the G-Loot Tracker running while you play.{lineBreak}Brawls use a “best-of” format. You can enter as many times as you want, and only your best scores count. That means if you lose your cool in a match and don’t perform as well as you’d like, you can try again, and your lower score won’t matter.{lineBreak}For each entry to a Brawl, you pay 1 Token. Your score from the next game round you play will go towards your Brawl total.
howItWorksSection.brawlTitle=BRAWL
howItWorksSection.missionRewardsBody=Mission Rewards are how you turn your XP into useful stuff like Coins or Tokens. Each time you reach a milestone in the Mission Rewards, you unlock another reward.{lineBreak}Mission Rewards and XP reset each week so you'll always have something new to work towards.
howItWorksSection.missionRewardsTitle=MISSION REWARDS
howItWorksSection.missionsBody=Missions add a little extra challenge to your game by giving\n          you objectives to achieve while you play. These could range from\n          winning a certain number of rounds to getting kills with a\n          particular weapon and are available across all of our supported\n          games.{lineBreak}To start competing in Missions, all you need to do is run the\n          G-Loot Tracker while you play. Each time you successfully\n          complete a Mission, you earn XP, which you use to claim Mission\n          Rewards. You can complete a set number of Missions each day, and\n          new ones appear every 24 hours. Keep an eye on the Tracker and\n          gloot.com to see your progress and check out what's new.
howItWorksSection.missionstitle=MISSIONS
howItWorksSection.monthlyShowdownBody=The top players in Weekly Brawls can earn tickets to the Monthly Showdown for a chance to win prize money.{lineBreak}The top players in Weekly Brawls can earn tickets to the Monthly Showdown for a chance to win prize money.{lineBreak}Monthly Showdowns are traditional esports tournaments with a knockout format. Create your own party with your teammates or join solo, and we’ll match you with other G-Loot players to form a party.
howItWorksSection.monthlyShowdownTitle=MONTHLY SHOWDOWN
howItWorksSection.pcAppParagraph1=The G-Loot Tracker is at the heart of the G-Loot experience. It’s what lets you track your stats while you play and take part in Missions, Brawls, and other competitions. When you run G-Loot and start playing a supported game, the app starts “listening” for certain game events such as kills or headshots.{lineBreak}
howItWorksSection.pcAppParagraph2=These events are used to play in competitions, track your stats, and build up your player identity.{lineBreak}That’s it. Because all G-Loot is doing is listening for your game events, it can be very lightweight and doesn’t affect your game performance.
howItWorksSection.shopParagraph=Turn your wins into prizes!{lineBreak}Earn Coins in Brawls and the Daily Loot Streak, and spend them in the shop. Give yourself extra motivation while you game by setting your eyes on a prize and working towards buying it.{lineBreak}Visit the <a>G-Loot shop.</a>
howItWorksSection.shopTitle=SHOP
howItWorksSection.teamsParagraph=Team up with your friends to compete in tournaments. {lineBreak}To choose who joins your party for a tournament, you need to be on the same team. Anyone can create a team and invite other players to join them. As a team captain, you can manage your members, choose your team nickname and images, and form parties. {lineBreak}Because you’ll form parties for each tournament, not everyone in your team needs to play the same games. Even if some of you compete together in Apex Legends while others play PUBG, you can still be part of the same team.
howItWorksSection.teamsTitle=TEAMS
howItWorksSection.tournamentsParagraph=In tournaments, multiple teams compete in brackets to become the ultimate champions. Unlike Brawls, you compete in the same servers and matches as your opponents in tournaments.{lineBreak}To compete, you and your party will need to register, check-in for your tournament, and join the Discord channel. You’ll then receive the information you need about your upcoming match and instructions for joining the server.{lineBreak}Want to know more? Check out the tournament FAQs.
